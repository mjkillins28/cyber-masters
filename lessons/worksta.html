		<p> Learning to set up a workstation is important because for the majority of the career fields require a workstation for you to work at therefore, knowing how to set up a workstation can be a time saver and problem solver. Setting up a workstation is easy. First you gather all the supplies that you need. Then you ask or check for your natural posture. With that said then you make sure the cables from the keyboard and mouse are not loose and not showing too much from the front of the PC.  After all cables have been clear adjust the screen because you donâ€™t want to be looking up nor down while you are typing or researching something on the computer. Lastly, make sure everything works. Take a couple minutes and see if the monitor turns on, the keyboard is typing, the mouse clicks and that there is internet connection. </p>
